# Agile

This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software. It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints.

The general principles of the Agile Methodology include:

- Satisfy the client and continually develop software.
- Changing requirements are embraced for the clientâ€™s competitive advantage.
- Concentrate on delivering working software frequently. Delivery preference will be placed on the shortest possible time span.
- Developers and business people must work together throughout the entire project.
- Working software is the primary measurement of progress.
- Agile processes will promote development that is sustainable. Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain an indefinite, constant pace.
- Constant attention to technical excellence and good design will enhance agility.
- Simplicity is considered to be the art of maximizing the work that is not done, and it is essential.
- Self-organized teams usually create the best designs.
- At regular intervals, the team will reflect on how to become more effective, and they will tune and adjust their behavior accordingly.

The Agile methodology stipulates that there is a certain repetitiveness of the tasks that we follow which include a bunch of ceremonies that are religiously followed. The length of this set of repetitive tasks are kept small so that the turnaround time is quick and the stakeholders get instant feedback and have a better understanding of where the project is headed and course correct it towards the overall vision where required.

We will aiming to follow the below ceremonies as part of our software development.

### Triage
Schedule: Ongoing
Owner: Product Managers (PM and BAs)
Engagement: Product Owners and Key Stakeholders

This is the entry point for all requirements that come through. In Agile anyone is able to request for features/enhancements/bugs. Once such a request is received, the Triage team is responsible for diagnosing the incoming request to ensure that it has all relevant/required information. Once they validate this, the next step is to liaise with the key stakeholders to confirm if the request is something that aligns with the product vision. Should the stakeholders agree, the item is then discussed for priority and position in the backlog (order) and slotted at that position. Otherwise, the item is rejected and closed with the appropriate reason being attached to it.

This process is critical in ensuring that we are able to maintain a slim backlog.

### Backlog Refinement
Schedule: Ongoing
Owner: BAs
Engagement: Product Owners, Key stakeholders, Tech team (depending on the item being refined)

This is the the most critical of all the ceremonies that are being followed in the Agile methodology. In this stage, the backlog is reviewed top down (as the order is already set in the Triage phase). Each of the item is work upon in detail by the BAs to ensure that all the required information to deliver the user story is analyzed and added onto the description including the acceptance criteria and test cases etc. During this stage, the BAs will pull in the key stakeholders, development team (for tech input) as required. At the end of the stage, each item is expected to be agreed as requirements complete including having the correct sizing in user story points.

It is critical to ensure that at least 40% of the top of the backlog is in a health state at any given point in time.

### Sprint Planning
Schedule: Bi-weekly
Owner: SCRUM Master
Engagement: Product Managers, DEV team, Product Owners

This ceremony happens bi-weekly to help prepare for the next Sprint that is about to start. This ceremony typically will be very short as the backlog is already in the correct order of the priority and position with each of the items at the top being requirements complete. This meeting will just go through the top of the backlog list and pick items into the following Sprint based on the velocity of the team.

It is generally encouraged to pick a mix of high priority items with a few low hanging items as well so that if items were to slip the Sprint they are not high priority.

### SCRUM
Schedule: Daily
Owner: SCRUM Master
Engagement: DEV, Product Managers, Product Owners (good to have)

This is a daily ceremony where the entire team get together along with key stakeholders and discuss issues and open items and any blockers that needs resolving. Each member in the team walks through what they have done and what they will be doing and raise any blockers. The call should include everyone that will help in progressing any blockers.

### Retrospective
Schedule: End of Sprint
Owner: SCRUM Master
Engagement: DEV team, Product Managers

This ceremony is typically held at the end of every sprint. The team will discuss what went well and what went wrong and will incorporate the learnings into the future ceremonies. The aim is to get gradually better and not have too many what went wrong as we progress.
